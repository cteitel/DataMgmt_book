R for Data Science (2e). Chapter 23: Hierarchical data. Available: https://r4ds.hadley.nz/rectangling.html 20.3 What is non-tabular data? So far, we have worked with tabular data only - that is, we have a table where each column has the same number of rows (and vice versa), and the data in each column has the same structure (all numeric, all character, etc.). In R, these columns also have limited types of data they can accommodate (again: numeric, character, factor, etc.). Not all data meets these requirements, which means there are many more data structures out there. For example, spatial data (which we will cover soon) contains embedded metadata about the coordinate reference system, and each data point might be a polygon rather than simply a point with X and Y coordinates. You can also imagine a case where you might want to have multiple datasets relating to one another, without duplicating all the information (e.g., associating individual traits to hourly monitoring data without repeating the individual traits over and over in your data frame), or where you might want to store multiple models in a certain order. So far, we could only do any of this by creating a lot of separate objects in the environment - for example, a different named object for each of 10 models. 20.4 Lists A list is a hierarchical data structure that can contain any number of data types. Here’s an example: l1 &lt;- list(&quot;element1&quot;, 1, TRUE, c(&quot;this&quot;,&quot;is&quot;,&quot;a&quot;,&quot;vector&quot;), data.frame(num = c(1,2), lett = c(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;))) l1 ## [[1]] ## [1] &quot;element1&quot; ## ## [[2]] ## [1] 1 ## ## [[3]] ## [1] TRUE ## ## [[4]] ## [1] &quot;this&quot; &quot;is&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;vector&quot; ## ## [[5]] ## num lett ## 1 1 a ## 2 2 b Here, our list has four elements, each of which is a different data type or length (character, numeric, logical, a character vector, and a data frame). Because printing the list can take up space very quickly, we can summarize the contents of a list with the str() function: str(l1) ## List of 5 ## $ : chr &quot;element1&quot; ## $ : num 1 ## $ : logi TRUE ## $ : chr [1:4] &quot;this&quot; &quot;is&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;vector&quot; ## $ :&#39;data.frame&#39;: 2 obs. of 2 variables: ## ..$ num : num [1:2] 1 2 ## ..$ lett: chr [1:2] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; Lists can also be named: l1 &lt;- list(chr = &quot;element1&quot;, int = 1, log = TRUE, chr_v = c(&quot;this&quot;,&quot;is&quot;,&quot;a&quot;,&quot;vector&quot;), df = data.frame(num = c(1,2), lett = c(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot;))) str(l1) ## List of 5 ## $ chr : chr &quot;element1&quot; ## $ int : num 1 ## $ log : logi TRUE ## $ chr_v: chr [1:4] &quot;this&quot; &quot;is&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;vector&quot; ## $ df :&#39;data.frame&#39;: 2 obs. of 2 variables: ## ..$ num : num [1:2] 1 2 ## ..$ lett: chr [1:2] &quot;a&quot; &quot;b&quot; To extract elements from a list, we can use square brackets or names. If using square brackets, a single bracket will return a list and double brackets will return the element in its own structure: l1[1] ## $chr ## [1] &quot;element1&quot; l1[[1]] ## [1] &quot;element1&quot; The behavior might seem inconvenient, but means that we can subset a list using single brackets, but extract its elements using double brackets: l1[c(1,2)] # Returns a list with the first two elements ## $chr ## [1] &quot;element1&quot; ## ## $int ## [1] 1 l1[[c(1,2)]] # Does not work ## Error in l1[[c(1, 2)]]: subscript out of bounds Using a name works just like using double brackets. l1$chr ## [1] &quot;element1&quot; Finally, lists are designed to be hierarchical - in other words, each element of a list can also be a list (and so on and so forth). l2 &lt;- list( l1 = list(v1 = 1, v2 = 2, v2 = &quot;yes&quot;), l2 = list(v1 = 3, v2 = &quot;element2&quot;) ) str(l2) ## List of 2 ## $ l1:List of 3 ## ..$ v1: num 1 ## ..$ v2: num 2 ## ..$ v2: chr &quot;yes&quot; ## $ l2:List of 2 ## ..$ v1: num 3 ## ..$ v2: chr &quot;element2&quot; This property makes lists useful for containing data that is inherently hierarchical, for example a taxonomy (here, of hominids): hominid_taxonomy &lt;- list( Ponginae = list( Pongo = c(&quot;pygmaeus&quot;,&quot;abelii&quot;,&quot;tapanuliensis&quot;) ), Homininae = list( Gorilla = c(&quot;gorilla&quot;, &quot;beringei&quot;), Pan = c(&quot;paniscus&quot;, &quot;troglodytes&quot;), Homo = c(&quot;sapiens&quot;) ) ) hominid_taxonomy ## $Ponginae ## $Ponginae$Pongo ## [1] &quot;pygmaeus&quot; &quot;abelii&quot; &quot;tapanuliensis&quot; ## ## ## $Homininae ## $Homininae$Gorilla ## [1] &quot;gorilla&quot; &quot;beringei&quot; ## ## $Homininae$Pan ## [1] &quot;paniscus&quot; &quot;troglodytes&quot; ## ## $Homininae$Homo ## [1] &quot;sapiens&quot; Here, if I wanted to extract the species names within the genus Homo, I would use one of the following: hominid_taxonomy$Homininae$Homo ## [1] &quot;sapiens&quot; hominid_taxonomy[[&quot;Homininae&quot;]][[&quot;Homo&quot;]] ## [1] &quot;sapiens&quot; 20.5 Nested data frames (list-columns) We can combine lists and data frames in tidyverse by making a list into a column. To do so, the list must have the same number of elements as there are rows in the data frame, so that each row corresponds to one element of the list. Here’s an example: dat &lt;- tibble( ID = c(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;), ID_num = c(1, 2, 3), list_info = list(list(&quot;note&quot;, &quot;note&quot;), list(&quot;note&quot;), list(&quot;note&quot;, &quot;note&quot;, &quot;note&quot;)) ) dat ## # A tibble: 3 × 3 ## ID ID_num list_info ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;list&gt; ## 1 A 1 &lt;list [2]&gt; ## 2 B 2 &lt;list [1]&gt; ## 3 C 3 &lt;list [3]&gt; You can see that we now have a tibble with three columns, one of which is a list. This data structure is very useful under two scenarios: (1) the data itself is nested and you want to perform operations separately on the nested and non-nested portions, and (2) you want to store models for subsets of data. For example, if I have information for 100 different species but want to analyze them separately, I could group my data by species such that I have a list-column with all the data for that species, then loop across that list to run my analysis. This is much easier than having 100 data objects and 100 model objects (one for each species). If the list-column contains a data frame, we can also easily nest and unnest the data. For example, for the urban wildlife data, I might want to nest my data by the type of health metric measured. To do so, I use the nest() function in tidyr (part of tidyverse): urban_data &lt;- read_csv(here(&quot;data/raw/Murray-Sanchez_urban-wildlife.csv&quot;)) nrow(urban_data) ## [1] 516 urban_data_bymetric &lt;- nest(urban_data, data = -health) nrow(urban_data_bymetric) ## [1] 4 urban_data_bymetric ## # A tibble: 4 × 2 ## health data ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;list&gt; ## 1 parasites &lt;tibble [194 × 41]&gt; ## 2 condition &lt;tibble [60 × 41]&gt; ## 3 toxicants &lt;tibble [189 × 41]&gt; ## 4 stress &lt;tibble [73 × 41]&gt; Now, I have created a data frame with four rows, one for each health metric, and a column called data that contains a list of tibbles, each of which contains all the other columns corresponding to that health metric. The first argument in nest() indicates the data frame to work with, while the second indicates which columns to nest; in this case, we want to nest all columns except health. This is conceptually similar to using group_by(). To remove the list-column, we can use unnest(): urban_data2 &lt;- unnest(urban_data_bymetric, data) The first argument in unnest()indicates the data frame to work with, while the second indicates which columns to unnest (in theory, you could have multiple list- columns in your data set). There are two related functions, unnest_wider() and unnest_longer(), that you can also explore, which allow you to unnest lists (above, our list-column was a data frame, which made it more obvious how to unnest it). 20.6 Applying functions across lists (map) Storing data as a list makes sense in many cases, but it is much more powerful when we can apply functions (actions) across the list. The map() function in tidyverse (equivalent to lapply() for the base R users among you) works similarly to across(), but instead of applying to columns in a data frame, it applies to elements in a list. The functions enclosed in map() often become more complex that those you might use in across() because they can apply to data frames or lists, not just vectors. For example, let’s say we wanted to know the number of data points in each of our health metric groups. We could acheive this by using map() on the list-column: map(urban_data_bymetric$data, ~nrow(.x)) ## [[1]] ## [1] 194 ## ## [[2]] ## [1] 60 ## ## [[3]] ## [1] 189 ## ## [[4]] ## [1] 73 Notice that map() always returns a list. However, there are other forms of map() that create a vector, which you can use if your function will return something that makes sense as a vector. These functions include map_dbl() for numeric, map_int() for integers, map_chr() for characters, and map_lgl() for logical: map_int(urban_data_bymetric$data, ~nrow(.x)) ## [1] 194 60 189 73 To make this even more powerful, we can integrate it with mutate to add a new column to our data set: urban_data_bymetric &lt;- urban_data_bymetric %&gt;% mutate(n_obs = map_int(data, ~nrow(.x))) urban_data_bymetric ## # A tibble: 4 × 3 ## health data n_obs ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;list&gt; &lt;int&gt; ## 1 parasites &lt;tibble [194 × 41]&gt; 194 ## 2 condition &lt;tibble [60 × 41]&gt; 60 ## 3 toxicants &lt;tibble [189 × 41]&gt; 189 ## 4 stress &lt;tibble [73 × 41]&gt; 73 Here, we created a new column, n_obs, by mapping across the data list-column and pulling out the number of rows. Of course, this would have easily been doable with group_by() and summarize(), but we would have “lost” the rest of the data, at least temporarily, in doing so. 20.7 Saving lists and nested data frames So far, we have been able to save all our data as a .csv. CSVs are tabular, and so was our data. But opening a list outside of R is harder, so how can we save and communicate these types of data? One way to save data is as an RDS object. This is a compressed data format that will preserve all the features of your data; when you read it back in, everyting will remain the same (for example, if you manually set factor levels). It can also accomodate pretty much any data structure, including lists and nested data frames. To create an RDS object, use the saveRDS() function and include the .rds file extension: saveRDS(urban_data_bymetric, here(&quot;data/clean/urban_data_nested.rds&quot;)) While RDS objects are great for your own uses (for example, to save intermediate data products), they’re not great for sharing because they can’t easily be opened by anything other than R. For these cases, you are usually best off saving separate .csv files (for example, one for each health metric) in a new folder that contains them all. dir.create(here(&quot;data/clean/nested_urban_data/&quot;)) # make a new directory for the files for(i in 1:nrow(urban_data_bymetric)){ file_name &lt;- str_c(urban_data_bymetric$health[i], &quot;.csv&quot;) #create a new name for the file dat &lt;- urban_data_bymetric$data[[i]] # extract the data to save write_csv(dat, here(&quot;data/clean/nested_urban_data/&quot;, file_name)) # save! } dir(here(&quot;data/clean/nested_urban_data/&quot;)) # Check that files have been created Then, when you want to read them back in, you can use map() to re-create a list or tibble: files &lt;- dir(here(&quot;data/clean/nested_urban_data/&quot;)) # Get all file names health &lt;- str_remove(files, &quot;.csv&quot;) # Extract metric names from file names urban_data2 &lt;- tibble( health, data = map(files, ~read_csv(here(&quot;data/clean/nested_urban_data/&quot;, .x))) ) urban_data2 ## # A tibble: 4 × 2 ## health data ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;list&gt; ## 1 condition &lt;spc_tbl_ [60 × 41]&gt; ## 2 parasites &lt;spc_tbl_ [194 × 41]&gt; ## 3 stress &lt;spc_tbl_ [73 × 41]&gt; ## 4 toxicants &lt;spc_tbl_ [189 × 41]&gt; This is a somewhat silly example because we haven’t actually done anything to our data "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
